# Web-Based-Data-Analytics-and-Visualization-Platform

In today's data-driven world, organizations and individuals rely heavily on data analytics and visualization to extract meaningful insights. This project, Web-Based Data Analytics and Visualization Platform, is designed to provide an intuitive and efficient way to process, analyse, and visualize structured data in the form of CSV files.

The platform is built using Flask as the backend framework and HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the frontend interface. It allows users to upload CSV datasets, perform data manipulation, generate analytical insights, and create visual representations such as bar charts, line graphs, histograms, and scatter plots. The system ensures seamless interaction by offering sorting, filtering, and summarization features, enabling users to explore and interpret their data effectively.

The project aims to bridge the gap between complex data processing techniques and user-friendly interfaces by providing a web-based solution accessible to both technical and non-technical users. This tool is particularly beneficial for data analysts, researchers, and businesses looking for a quick and interactive way to derive insights without requiring advanced programming knowledge.

By integrating modern web technologies and data processing libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn, this platform enhances the decision-making process through effective data visualization and analytics. The implementation of session-based storage ensures continuity in data operations, making it a reliable and user-centric analytics tool.
